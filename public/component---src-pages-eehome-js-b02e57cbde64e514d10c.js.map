established in 1945\n                under Patna University with an intake of 20 students leading to\n                Bachelor of Science(Engineering) degree of four year\n                duration.The four year course was later changed to five year\n                integrated course in 1960 with intake of 30 students and it\n                continued up to 1972. Again four year course was introduced in\n                1972 with the same intake capacity of 30 students. The intake\n                was increased from 30 to 40 students in 2005-06 sessions and\n                further in 2006-07 the intake capacity has been increased to 60\n                students.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                In the year 1978 AICTE approved Post Graduate (PG) course\n                leading to M. Sc. (Engg) Degree in two specializations: (i)\n                Power System Engineering and (ii) Control System Engineering\n                with an intake capacity of 10 in each specialization.The intake\n                in PG program was further increased to 18 students per\n                specialization in 2004-05.The Microprocessor Laboratory and\n                Power electronics laboratory were setup to meet the requirement\n                of course curriculum and research activity.The advancement and\n                application of electronics and microcomputer in the field of\n                electrical engineering necessitated a major revision of the\n                syllabus for the UG program in 1977. A course in Microprocessor\n                was introduced along with many subjects in electronics leading\n                to orientation required for the modem technology, such as Analog\n                Electronics, Digital Electronics, Introduction to Communication\n                and Digital Signal Processing.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                The Electrical Engineering department has well qualified\n                faculty, majority of them are with Ph. D and M. Tech degree with\n                specialization in the field of electrical power, control system\n                and microcomputer based instrumentation & control. The\n                department has well qualified panel of visiting faculty from\n                academics and industry. They visit to the department at regular\n                interval to deliver expert lectures and discuss recent trends in\n                the field of Electrical Engg, Power system -generation,\n                transmission and distribution, Thyristorised controlled\n                electrical drives used in industry, microcomputer applications\n                in instrumentation and control etc. In recent past, the faculty\n                and students of the department have many publications in\n                journals and conferences (Approx. Forty). Many books on\n                different electrical engineering subjects have been authored by\n                the faculties of the department. Till date the department has\n                produces five Ph. Ds under Patna University. From 2009 Doctoral\n                program started under NIT Act 2007 and students have been\n                admitted and are continuing research.{\" \"}\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"dmainrow\" id=\"happening\">\n          <div className=\"col-6\">\n            <div className=\"row rowmarl3\">\n              <h1 data-aos=\"zoom-in-right\">Happenings</h1>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"row rowmarl3\">\n              <div id=\"depnoticewrap\">\n                {this.state.notices.map(notice => {\n                  const newtime = new Date().getTime()\n\n                  let d = Math.round((newtime -
